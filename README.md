Hi, Iâ€™m Kvochcka(real name Alexander,
but it is not necessary
to address me like that)
Iâ€™m interested in Data analysis
and visualization. At the moment I am a beginner data analyst, now I am actively studying programming languages for various analytical tasks. I have practical skills in the field of ETL, but so far I would not call myself an expert. I want to get practice on real problems and expand my portfolio.
*don't want to sound like a fool so I'll have to add my skills:*
- I have skills in analysis and visualization using SQL (MySQL, SQLite, Google BigQuery and Anaconda tools).
- I also have practical skills and knowledge in the field of visualization and analysis in Python.
- I have knowledge of mathematics, some topics: "Linear Algebra", "Differential Calculus" and "Discrete Mathematics". I also have skills in statistics and development of various analytical tests.
- I love learning new practical tools
*-Not an important point, but I will add. In addition, I study and try to practice machine learning*
I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on some interesting projects.  I will be very happy if my skills are useful)
